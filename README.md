# Hypixel AutoTip
## What it does
Automatically tips all players with active boosters on the Hypixel Network around every 15 minutes using /tipall so you dont have to.

The only reason I made this mod is that I couldn't find any mods on fabric 1.21 for autotipping, so I made one myself.

This is my first Minecraft mod so it might not be perfect but it works well in my testing. When you first join Hypixel just press `NumPad1` (rebindable in Minecraft's keybinds settings) and it will start autotipping players. You can then press `NumPad1` again and it will stop autotipping.
